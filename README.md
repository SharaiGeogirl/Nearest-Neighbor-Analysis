Nearest Neighbour Analysis 
### Data source

I randomly generated 500 tourist (points) data in South Holland. The National monuments data was downloaded fromÂ https://services.rce.geovoorziening.nl/web/.
The analysis determines the nearest national monument to the tourist, given their location.

### Data cleaning and Analysis

For the data cleaning, I used Python libraries such as numpy, shapely and geopandas to explore the data and visualise it in a map as shown below.
I then calculated the average distance between tourist and monument is 6.41 km.

### Findings

The output of the nearest neighbor analysis conducted shows that the average distance between a tourist and a national monument in South Holland is 6.41 km.
The data was cleaned using Python libraries such as numpy, shapely, and geopandas. The analysis was conducted by randomly generating 500 tourist data points
in South Holland and using data on national monuments downloaded from https://services.rce.geovoorziening.nl/web/. The results were visualized on a map using
Python and the output of the analysis was also presented in a graph.
